BookTracker
===========

Tracks Authors/Books 

Due to the fact that I can't remember what I've read and end up buying the same book twice I now log Authors I like and their books to keep track of what I own and what I've read.

A report can be emailed of unread/unowned books to take to the bookstore.


Uses:
